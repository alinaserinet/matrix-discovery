# Matrix Discovery

## Overview

Matrix Discovery is a project focused on exploring Matrix Decompositions, Linear Algebra, and their applications in the context of learning from data. The project aims to provide tools and insights for deciphering patterns and gaining a deeper understanding of data through the lens of linear algebraic techniques.

## Features

-   **Matrix Decompositions:** Explore various matrix decomposition techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), LU decomposition, and more.

-   **Linear Algebra Tools:** Leverage a set of powerful linear algebra tools for efficient data analysis and manipulation.

-   **Learning from Data:** Apply matrix-based methods to extract meaningful insights and patterns from datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/)
-   [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (install via `pip install numpy`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alinaserinet/matrix-discovery.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd matrix-discovery
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
